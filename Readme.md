# Build a Temperature Conversion Program.
--- 
Create a program that converts temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales.
The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the origin unit of measurement. It should then 
convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user.
