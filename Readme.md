# Build a Temperature Conversion Program.

Create a program that converts temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales.
The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the origin unit of measurement. It should then 
convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user.

 # Create a Guessing game.

 Build a Program that generates a random number and challenges the 
 user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the 
 generated number and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It should continue 
 until the number and the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts 
 it took to win the game.
